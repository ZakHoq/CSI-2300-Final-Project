What are we creating? A video game.
Why are we creating it? For entertainment purposes.
How to use it? You can use it as an application and the controls consist of the Left and Right Arrow Key plus the Space Bar.
Plan and estimate of effort? High effort, start off with screen classes, then enemy and player classes, then create instances of the classes 
and use them to make game logic.
